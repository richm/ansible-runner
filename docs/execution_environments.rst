Using Runner with Execution Environmnets
========================================

**Execution Environments** are meant to be a consistent, reproducible, portable,
and sharable method to run Ansible Automation jobs in the exact same way on
your laptop as they are executed in `Ansible AWX <https://github.com/ansible/awx/`_.
This aids in the development of automation jobs and Ansible Content that is
meant to be run in **Ansible AWX**, `Ansible Tower <https://www.ansible.com/products/tower>`_,
or via `Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform <https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-platform>`_
in a predictable way.

More specifically, the term **Execution Environments** within the context of
**Ansible Runner** refers to the container runtime execution of **Ansible** via
**Ansible Runner** within an `OCI Compliant Container Runtime
<https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec>`_ using an `OCI Compliant
Container Image <https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/>`_ that
appropriately bundles `Ansible Base <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>`_,
`Ansible Collection Content <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview>`_,
and the runtime dependencies required to support these contents. The base
image is the `Red Hat Enterprise Linux Universal Base Image
<https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/ubi>`_ and the build tooling
provided by `Ansible Builder <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-builder>`_
aids in the creation of these images.

All aspects of running **Ansible Runner** in standalone mode (see: :ref:`standalone`)
are true here with the exception that the process isolation is inherently a
container runtime (`podman <https://podman.io/>`_ by default).

Emulating the Ansible CLI
-------------------------

As previously mentioned, a primary goal of adding the Execution Environment CLI
interface is to aid in the creation of Ansible Automation jobs and content. The
approach here is to make it as similar as possible to the way **Ansible** users
are accustomed to using Ansible today. There are two subcommands, ``adhoc`` and
``playbook`` that have been added to accommodate this. The ``adhoc`` subcommand
to ``ansible-runner`` is synonymous with ``ansible`` and the ``playbook``
subcommand to ``ansible-runner`` is synonymous with ``ansible-playbook``.
Examples are below.

Running Ansible adhoc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example invocation using the ``ping`` module and ``localhost`` as target::

  $ ansible-runner adhoc localhost -m ping

Something to note here is that implicit ``localhost`` in this context is a containerized instantiation of an Ansible Execution Environment and as such you will not get Ansible Facts about your system if using the ``setup`` module.

Running Ansible ansible-playbook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example invocation using the ``demo.yml`` playbook and ``inventory.ini`` inventory file::

  $ ansible-runner playbook demo.yml -i inventory.ini

Something to note here is that implicit ``localhost`` in this context is a containerized instantiation of an Ansible Execution Environment and as such you will not get Ansible Facts about your system if using ``gather_facts: true`` and targeting ``localhost`` in your playbook without explicit host definition in your inventory.

To run with an image built with `ansible-builder` using `docker`::

  $ ansible-runner playbook --container-image=my-aee-image:latest --container-runtime=docker demo.yml -i inventory.ini

Notes and Considerations
------------------------

There are some differences between using Ansible Runner and running Ansible directly from the
command line that have to do with configuration, content locality, and secret data.

Secrets
^^^^^^^

Typically with Ansible you are able to provide secret data via a series of
mechanisms, many of which are pluggable and configurable. When using
Ansible Runner, however, certain considerations need to be made; these are analogous to
how Ansible AWX and Tower manage this information.

See :ref:`inputdir` for more information

Container Names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like all ansible-runner jobs, each job has an identifier associated with it
which is also the name of the artifacts subfolder where results are saved to.
When a container for job isolation is launched, it will be given a name
of ``ansible_runner_<job identifier>``. Some characters from the job
identifier may be replaced with underscores for compatibility with
names that Podman and Docker allow.

This name is used internally if a command needs to be ran against the container
at a later time (e.g., to stop the container when the job is canceled).

~/.ssh/ symlinks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to make the ``adhoc`` and ``playbook`` container execution of Ansible
easier, Ansible Runner will automatically bind mount your local ssh agent
UNIX-domain socket (``SSH_AUTH_SOCK``) into the container runtime. However, this
does not work if files in your ``~/.ssh/`` directory happen to be symlinked to
another directory that is also not mounted into the container runtime. Ansible
Runner ``adhoc`` and ``playbook`` subcommands provide the ``--container-volume-mount``
option to address this, among other things.

Here is an example of an ssh config file that is a symlink:

::

        $ $ ls -l ~/.ssh/config
        lrwxrwxrwx. 1 myuser myuser 34 Jul 15 19:27 /home/myuser/.ssh/config -> /home/myuser/dotfiles/ssh_config

        $ ansible-runner playbook \
            --container-volume-mount /home/myuser/dotfiles/:/home/myuser/dotfiles/ \
            my_playbook.yml -i my_inventory.ini
